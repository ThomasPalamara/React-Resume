So be ready for the questions.<br>I’m a science lover and am keen on IT, video game, science fiction, music …</p><p>After high school I started to learn chemistry. As it turns out life led me back to computers with the my two-years degree in <span class=\"highlight\" data-highlight=\"1\">electrical engineering and computer science</span>. It was really stimulating to learn programming and animate robots and other electronic devices.</p><p>Finally, I had the opportunity to develop an android application as part of an internship. I enjoyed this more abstract approach of programming. This is why I ended up learning <span class=\"highlight\" data-highlight=\"2\">web development</span> and really liked it.</p><p>Since then I moved in <span class=\"highlight\" data-highlight=\"3\">London</span> to work in this great city and pursue a fulfilling career of font-end developer</p>"
