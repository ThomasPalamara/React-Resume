Be ready for the questions.\n\nI’m a science lover and a geek keen on IT, video game, science fiction, music …\n\nOn my leisure I love to work on side projects with my friends to put new learned technology into practice, read scientific news and designing small and mere electronic project (using raspberry PI) to satisfy my curiosity.\n Surly I also enjoy some relaxation watching TV show and meeting my friends"
